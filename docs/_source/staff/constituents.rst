Constituents
============

Constituents are your list of email recipients, made up by a combination of 1) your imports into the EveryVoter platform and 2) your own manual additions to the list. Constituents are unique per-organization per-email address, which means if your organizationâ€™s copy of EveryVoter already contains a specific email address, that constituent cannot be added again.

Bulk Importing Constituents
---------------------------

Constituents can be imported in bulk using the Bulk Import functionality. The speed of bulk imports is impacted by the amount of computing, database, and geocoding resources allocated to EveryVoter. Constituent imports are done in approximately the order they are received.

You can view the status of in-progress and past exports in EveryVoter.

You can also download the original import copy, as well as download any errors with the import and details about why a particular failure happened. Usually, this is because of a geocoding error (e.g., a bad address) or an attempt to create a duplicate constituent in the organization.
