Every organization on EveryVoter can control their own settings, such as their name and the address their emails are sent from.

Your **organization** is your entire copy of EveryVoter. It’s comprised of templates, landing pages, mailings, constituents, staff, and all the other parts of EveryVoter unique to your program. You can customize many of the features specific to your organization in EveryVoter.

Staff
-----

“Staff” in EveryVoter are users that have been granted permission in EveryVoter to act as an administrator of an organization.

Adding staff can only be done by Super Users (administrators of the underlying EveryVoter system) at this time. All staff start as constituents in an organization, and must first be created either using the individual constituent signup process then their email should be provided to a Super User.
