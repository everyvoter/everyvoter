Public Constituent Guide
========================

The **Public Constituent Guide** is a guide for publicly-viewable components of EveryVoter applicable to “constituents,” the people who will be receiving emails. This guide assumes your copy of EveryVoter is located at https://vote.your-domain.us/.

Adding and Editing Constituents

Adding Constituents
===================

Constituents can be added to EveryVoter in two ways:

1) Via a user import, or
2) Via the “Create Constituent” page

Constituents are unique per-organization per-email address, which means if an organization’s copy of EveryVoter already contains an email address, that constituent cannot be added again.

The URL to create a constituent is https://vote.your-domain.us/user/create/

Update Information
==================

Constituents can update their information by clicking a “Manage My Information” or “Update My Information” link in emails they receive.

The format of this URL is: https://vote.your-domain.us/user/user-id/

Unsubscribe
===========

Constituents can unsubscribe at https://vote.your-domain.us/unsubscribe/

If the constituent clicks the “Unsubscribe” link inside an email, the user’s email address is auto-filled and the unsubscribe is associated with that specific mailing.
